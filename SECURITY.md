# SECURITY.md
## Overview
Security is something I consider a high priority for this project, (it's in the name). If you will/did take your time to report a vulnerability, then I owe a personal thank you.

## The checks
Make sure you are using the latest code in this repo, that modifications are not effecting this, and that the security issue is not something that would better upstream (I can do some patches to an extent, but something like
editing nivida drivers is out of scope). 

## The process
This project, being a very informal and small one, does not have a certain way for you to report, but several. You can either privately report it (with the security tab)
create a pull request or an issue. If you decide to take the pull request route (the recommend way) then try to keep the code minimal, clean and maintainable.
